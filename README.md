# 🚀 Space Invader Game 🎮

A 2D arcade-style space shooter game built using **Python** and **Pygame**, where the player controls a spaceship and shoots down waves of aliens. Designed for fun, practice, and mastering Python fundamentals.



## 🎯 Project Objectives

* Build a fully functional retro-style game using Python.
* Understand game loops, collision detection, sprite management, and audio integration.
* Strengthen logical thinking and problem-solving.



## 🧠 Game Features

* 🕹️ **Player-controlled spaceship** with smooth left and right movement.
* 👾 **Multiple enemies (aliens)** that descend and move in a wave pattern.
* 💥 **Shooting mechanic** with bullet firing and hit detection.
* 🎯 **Collision detection** using Euclidean distance for bullet-enemy interactions.
* 🔊 **Integrated audio**:

  * Background music loop.
  * Sound effects for firing and explosions.
* 🧮 **Real-time score tracking** displayed on screen.
* 🔄 **Game over logic** when enemies reach the player's base.



## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* 🐍 **Python 3.x** – Core programming language used.
* 🎮 **Pygame** – Game development library used to handle graphics, events, and audio.
* 📦 **Math** and **Random** modules – For enemy positioning and collision logic.
